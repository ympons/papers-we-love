* [A History of Haskell: Being Lazy With Class](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/history.pdf) by Paul Hudak, John Hughes, Simon Peyton Jones
* :scroll: [Tackling the Awkward Squad: monadic input/output, concurrency, exceptions, and foreign-language calls in Haskell](tackling-the-awkward-squad-monadic-input-output-concurrency-exceptions-and-foreign-language-calls-in-haskell.pdf) by Simon Peyton Jones
* :scroll: [Making a Fast Curry: Push/Enter vs. Eval/Apply for Higher-order Languages](making-a-fast-curry-push-enter-versus-eval-apply-for-higher-order-languages.pdf) by Simon Marlow and Simon Peyton Jones. A classic... describes well the execution model GHC uses for Haskell, and catches the brilliant authors in a design pivot from original intuition to new conclusions based on empirical data.
* :scroll: [A Poor Man's Concurrency Monad](a-poor-mans-concurrency-monad.pdf) by Koen Claessen. Paper describes how without adding any primitives to the language, you could define a concurrency monad transformer in Haskell.
* :scroll: [Parallel Generational-Copying Garbage Collection with a Block-Structured Heap](../garbage_collection/parallel_generational_copying_garbage_collection_with_a_block_structured_heap.pdf). In Haskell, data immutability forces us to produce a lot of temporary data but also helps to collect this garbage rapidly. This paper explains how the Glasgow Haskell Compiler accomplishes this task in a simple, yet effective, manner with no programmer intervention.
