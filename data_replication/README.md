    > Eventual consistency aims to ensure that replicas of some mutable shared object converge without foreground synchronisation.  We study a principled approach: to base the design of shared data types on some simple formal conditions that are sufficient to guarantee even- tual consistency. We call these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).
